# EffektPy

A tiny Python-inspired functional language with static type inference, implemented in Effekt using effects and handlers.

## Overview

EffektPy provides a small, expression-focused language with a Python-like surface syntax and a functional core.  
The interpreter includes lexing, parsing, desugaring to a lambda-calculus–style core language, static type inference, and an evaluator.

## Status

This project is currently in early development.  
More documentation, examples, and implementation details will follow.

## Goals

- Clean and minimal surface syntax  
- Functional semantics  
- Static type inference  
- Modular interpreter architecture using Effekt’s effects and handlers
